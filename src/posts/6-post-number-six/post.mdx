I have been looking for good programs to level up my Computer Science concepts while learning new technologies and leveling up skills. I am excited to share my experiences completing and achieving a CS50 Web Programming Verified Certification by Harvard University.

Since I did my Bootcamp in 2021 and found my first full-time development job, I had some challenges and did not work on other programs or certifications, but I was still learning new technologies, working, and building client and side projects.

As I currently don't have a CS degree (hopefully one day), I have been feeling the need to learn more about Computer Science and the way it's learned on colleges while learning concepts and technologies that I don't necessarily use at work but could be nice to learn and build new things with.

Recently, I decided to start this program after hearing about a lot of great learning experiences and seeing progress from others doing this program, and I couldn't wait to get to it!!

Quick overview:

- Registering in the program is simple and FREE (there is an option to upgrade if you want to opt for the certification)

- It is a self-paced program with a length of 8 weeks with a total of 6 projects.

- The modules or weeks are divided by content as follows:

<ul className="ul-post">
  <li> > Git</li>
  <li> > Python</li>
  <li> > Django</li>
  <li> > SQL, Models, and Migrations</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li> > User Interfaces</li>
  <li> > Testing, CI/CD</li>
  <li> > Scalability and Security</li>
</ul>
