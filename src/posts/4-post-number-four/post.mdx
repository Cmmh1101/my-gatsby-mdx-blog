Finishing my Bootcamp week 1 I could see the value of the camp and actually I liked it a lot. As soon as the live class was over I jumped in to start the week's 2 tasks, and complete them all on that same day.
You know some people might think that I don't have family, job, hobbies, or better things to do on a Saturday afternoon... But, the truth is that I actually have all of them together and that is what keeps me going.

So going back to the topic, I finished all tasks with a good understanding of the components in bootstrap, learned about tabs, cards, forms, and more, completed the codopen challenges and quiz for the week.
The best part of week 2 is that we started the process of our personal or group projects. I say the best part because, in my journey, I had plenty of ideas but I was missing the actual process from beginning to end which is a big reason why I entered the Bootcamp so, this week I worked with my project idea from zero and had fun with it and after that I also had time to start doing a basic layout for the website while the majority of the time I had spent it reading, listening and practicing J.S.

Our workshop for this week was fun, we had a review of this weeks material as well as this week's material, as well as the introduction of some new concepts which our instructor did through a Kahoot game while explaining or clarifying any misconception something good as well, is that he is providing explanations as he is looking for and showing the documentation which reinforces the huge importance on referring to documentation often.

After the review, we had to do our project pitch where we presented our idea to the class. This was a great exercise of how is how it is to actually do a pitch elevator as well as to receive and provide feedback to each other which personally made me realize that I wanted to consider some other ideas that I had in mind.
At this point, I reach out to my instructor sharing the ideas I had in mind and he quickly pointed me to another of my ideas so I took that feedback. The end of our workshop was working with our final assignment for the week.

At the end of each workshop we have to complete an assignment to be graded and move on. This challenge was a little longer than last week's assignment I liked it because it got me thinking and looking for documentation. I was able to complete the challenge while we had group work time which I really enjoy because at that time we can support each other and figure things out.

So far so good here at nucamp Bootcamp, looking forward to a new week and diving into more complexity with javascript review and continuing shaping my project idea.
Thank you and hopefully I will be back soon with my week 3 into nucamp!.
See you later!
