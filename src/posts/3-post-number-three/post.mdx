Is a coding Bootcamp worthy? It is a common question within the web developer network. Some people say that they are worthy others say the opposite. A few months ago, I asked the same question to my network. I received feedback, made my choice, and realized that as a standard question, more aspiring developers might have the same so, I decided to post about my choice and journey, hoping that it can be helpful for someone out there.

I started my journey at the end of 2019. Still, it wasn't until mid-2020 when I realized that I could do something with the skills I was acquiring, so I decided to work towards a career change after discovering my passion for web development. I started my journey as a self-taught using free courses and programs General Assembly Dash intro course, Freecodecamp, and youtube.

As I was learning on my own, I started building websites, freelancing, learning, and progressing until I started looking for jobs, and soon I realized that I needed to add more skills to be competitive in the job search.
At this point, I have already heard about different boot camps and tons of success stories which lead me to apply to some, even getting accepted only to find out soon about the high cost and how time demanding they are. So that idea wasn't an option anymore.

So, I continued on my own but still felt the process could be better and faster. Then my husband showed me an ad about Nucamp, which appeared to be an affordable option, so I started checking Nucamp, researching, and asking about it in my network.
I'm so grateful I received reviews from my network about this camp because they provided me with their own experience and different points of view, too many to mention but, I certainly can tell you a summary of what caught my attention:

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>
      <em>You get what you put in</em>
    </b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      <em>You will have a mix of self-learning and instruction</em>
    </b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      <em>Your instructors will guide you and help if needed</em>
    </b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      <em>Group experience</em>
    </b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      <em>Accountability</em>
    </b>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
      <em>Price and time flexibility</em>
    </b>
  </li>
</ol>

Not everyone needs the structure, and not everyone can learn on their own, mostly when life is complicated with responsibilities, job, family, etc. So, that feedback given by network members was enough to get my conclusions:

- I know I'm an extremely hardworking person, and if I could get what I put in, that will be in my favor.
- I know my life is busy and if I could continue learning at my own pace but at the same time having an instructor guiding me and available just in case if I need assistance with anything, then it would be good for me.
- I can work on my own but, still, I enjoy having teammates to study, work on projects, and share knowledge and experiences.
- I have always enjoyed having accountability partners whenever I start a challenge; coding, fitness, and wellness challenges are my favorites. I genuinely like to have accountability from friends and network.
- I will get the perfect combination of time flexibility to accommodate my learning around my full-time teaching job, three children, husband, extra activities while still having an affordable price was what I was needing.

Based on the above, I decided to give Nucamp a try and go in with all I can provide, so; I joined the Full Stack Web and Mobile Development program. I will be sharing with you all my experiences inside Nucamp every week, and if you feel that this is something that you need for your journey, I'm leaving you the link and a code that you can use to register.

Week 1 is coming soon.
I wish you the best on your journey, and let's continue growing together in tech!
